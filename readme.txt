###Upgrading From A Previous Version###

To upgrade from a previous version of this plugin, delete the entire folder and files from the previous version of the plugin and then follow the installation instructions below.

Alternatively, you can have WordPress upgrade it for you automatically via the Plugin Admin Page.

###Installing The Plugin###

Extract all files from the ZIP file, making sure to keep the file structure intact, and then upload the plugin's folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`.

This should result in the following file structure:

`- wp-content
    - plugins
        - featured-bloggers
            | readme.txt
            | screenshot1.png
            | featured-bloggers.php`

Then just visit your admin area and activate the plugin.

###Installing The Plugin For WordPress MU###
